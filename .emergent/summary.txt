The trajectory outlines the previous AI engineer's work on the Cofau mobile application, starting from an initial UI-only build to a full-stack Expo, FastAPI, and MongoDB integrated system. Key challenges addressed included persistent authentication flow issues (SecureStore incompatibility on web, navigation conflicts), which were eventually resolved by implementing cross-platform storage and refining navigation logic.

Significant features integrated include dynamic data fetching for the Feed and Profile screens, complete with image URL resolution and user-specific details. The Add Post functionality was fully wired to the backend for image upload and post creation. The development then expanded to social features like Likes and Comments, with the backend endpoints existing but requiring careful frontend integration and debugging (e.g., comment submission and display issues).

The latter part of the trajectory focused heavily on implementing and debugging the Explore screen, which suffered from numerous issues: static placeholder images, width is not defined errors, and initially not being accessible via navigation. A crucial discovery was that the user was mistakenly viewing the Search screen, not the Explore screen, as the Explore icon was missing from the global bottom navigation. The final attempts involved adding the Explore icon to the bottom navigation across all main screens, which unfortunately introduced new JSX syntax errors due to code corruption during bulk edits.

<product_requirements>
The Cofau app is a food-photo and review community, built as a React Native (Expo) mobile application integrated with a FastAPI + MongoDB backend.

**Key UI Screens and Features Implemented/Integrated:**
*   **Authentication (Login, Signup, Forgot Password, OTP):** Fully functional backend integration, secure token storage (cross-platform), and correct frontend navigation after login.
*   **Feed Screen:** Dynamically fetches and displays posts from , including real images, user info, ratings (fixed to 1-10 scale), timestamps, and like/comment counts.
*   **Profile Screen:** Displays authenticated user data from  (username, email, avatar, level, points). Includes Update Profile and Logout buttons (functionality for Update Profile is pending).
*   **Add Post Screen:** Complete integration for creating new posts, including photo/video upload, a 10-star rating system, review text, Google Maps link, and post submission to .
*   **Explore Screen:** A new screen () implemented to display various types of content (Trending, Top-Rated Posts, Reviewers, Categories, Nearby). It dynamically fetches data from new backend  endpoints and renders real images in a 3-column grid.
*   **Social Features (Likes, Comments, Follow):**
    *   **Likes System:** Integrated with  for toggling likes with optimistic UI updates, and reflecting like counts on feed items.
    *   **Comments System:** Backend endpoints for  and  exist. A frontend screen for comments () has been created, though full display and submission debugging was ongoing.
    *   **Follow System:** Backend endpoints for  and  exist. Frontend integration for a Follow button and count updates is pending.

**Backend Features Implemented:**
*   Full API for user authentication, posts CRUD, feed, likes, comments, followers, and user profiles.
*   Media file uploads are handled, with static files served correctly via .
*   A points and level system for users is in place (+25 points per post, badges at levels 4, 8, 12).
*   New Explore endpoints for trending, top-rated posts, reviewers, and categories have been added and are functional.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a JSX syntax error in . This error occurred after an attempt to standardize the bottom navigation across all main screens (including , , , , ) by adding a new Explore icon.

The previous action was an attempt to replace the entire bottom navigation section of  with a clean, user-provided code block. However, this action resulted in a new JSX syntax error on line 100, indicating an issue with an unclosed  tag. This suggests that the replacement might not have been perfectly clean, or existing file corruption (potentially from prior bulk edits via  commands, as seen with ) is interfering. The file's state is likely malformed around the bottom navigation, preventing the app from compiling correctly.
